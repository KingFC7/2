Eventhough my Papa died this year, I'd still remember those days that we're happy and those days cannot be replaced becuase it is made by love. I love my family, through ups and downs, we survive together. Stand or fall, together.</figcaption>

			<figcaption>The third child, Rod Vincent Capili</figcaption>

Growing up, I looked up to my older brother and sister and admired their accomplishments, while also learning from their mistakes. As the baby of the family, I was often the center of attention, and my siblings would dote on me and tease me in equal measure. Despite being the youngest, I have always tried to carve out my own path and make my mark on the world, and I am grateful for the love and support of my family as I navigate my way through life.</figcaption>
